# genderless

**Removes \*innen|:innen from german webpages.**

## What it does

This extension just includes:

- a content script, "genderless.js", that is injected into any pages on .de domains.

Simply replaces occurences of gendered language with non-gendered one. Just because I think its easier to read that way :)
